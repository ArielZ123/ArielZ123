# Hi there, I'm ArielZ 🤙

HI my name is Ariel, I learn lua and html in my free time.
i was working for a while on my project OverTrue RolePlay for almost one year and decided to stop him due to private decisions.
Now i am focusing on publish some of the systems that i made for OverTrue RolePlay by the time to the fivem community for free.

# Note📋:
I am asking from you that if you see any problems with my codes / scripts that I publish keep in touch with me on my discord: 𝓐𝓻𝓲𝓮𝓵𝓩#5022
or if you cant DM me send me your discord name in the fivem forums and i will be happy to help / learn / fix everything.
I am new and open to learn from everyone.
